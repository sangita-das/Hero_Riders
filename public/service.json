  "description": "Welcome to the Accelerated Driving Prep Course. Driver Training Services created this program in response to the multitudes of students who passed their permit test, yet still are having issues applying the information learned when driving. The course is designed to give an in-depth view of the safe driving material covered, something the traditional permit test fails to do. For example, the traditional permit test may be helpful for identifying road signs, but our course will not just help drivers to identify the signs, but also help to explain what they mean and how to respond. Because the Accelerated Driving Prep Course is particularly helpful at giving new drivers information that experienced drivers already understand and practice, we highly recommended this course for newly permitted drivers as well as those preparing to take the test to be permitted."

As new drivers face dangerous situations on the road, it is important they not only know what to do, but that they do what is necessary as they encounter driving hazards. Research indicates that simulator training assists in the development of brain “muscle memory”, resulting in safer, swifter responses by the driver."

Everyone’s luck runs out at some point.Did you know that, if you’re in a crash and the responding officer writes you up for one of these violations, your insurance premiums could rise by 25% or more? That’s even if you’re not at fault.The good news is, we can help. Take a drive with one of our professional driving instructors and get some expert feedback about your driving. In most cases, we can recommend simple behavior changes that can dramatically decrease your odds of being involved in a car crash.

Instead, it’s a standardized performance measure, scored by computer that gives employers a clear numerical ranking for a particular driver as compared with thousands of others.It’s up to individual companies to decide how much risk they are willing to take. Some companies are satisfied administering a simple online quiz to their drivers a few times each decade. Others do nothing and hope for the best.
